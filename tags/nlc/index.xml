The gain can be increased by increasing the value of the gain resistor.
I made a video using two lux modules to simulate some bird songs, using them like a kind of optical theremin.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Build Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- I experimented with 4 different values of gain resistor: 1M, 2.2M, 3.0M and 4.7M Ohms which will be useful in giving a different response under the same lighting conditions, or to choose one to use depending on how bright or dark the performance environment is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- upon testing I thought I had messed it up somehow because the CV outputs were extremely &amp;lsquo;dirty&amp;rsquo;, when I used them in a 1v/oct VCO input the sounds was very noisy. I realized that it was actually the lights causing the noise, because I have LED pot lights in my house and they must be flickering and causing the CV output to look like a square wave! Shining a flashlight with an incandescent bulb on the modules resulted in a smooth tone with no noise. Fascinating!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- this is a build involving SMD components, including a SOIC TL072. I used the iron for this one, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably break out the paste and air for a more involved build. It is a pretty good first time module for SMD, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have very many components at all.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
