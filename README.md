# synthDIY.space

The synthDIY.space blog is built on hugo, and deployed on GitHub Pages.

Hugo generates a static website on the gh-pages branch of this repository, running every time you update or add a file in the main repository.

I am using the TERMINAL theme, and disqus commenting is enabled on posts.
