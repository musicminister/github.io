Zlob Modular is the work of Keven Michael-Onur Kalaycıoğlu-Żłobnicki. Their module called the [Vnicursal](https://zlobmodular.com/product/vnicursal-vca/) is 6 VCAs in an 8HP wide module, what's not to like! Each input has a CV and then the output, either individual or there is a summed out at the bottom if you want to use it as a mixer for audio. VCAs can be used for much more than audio, and they are a must have module in every rack.

Notes:

\- this is the latest revision, v666 (haha) which utilizes resistor arrays to cut down on the number of individual components, much easier to work with. More modules should start using arrays if they are sticking with thru hole designs and need lots of resistors.

\- this tested out great on the workbench except for channel 6, upon re-inspection I discovered I had skipped two of the leads! Haha, that's not going to work! Did those right quick and all 6 channels working perfectly. Hurray for testing!

\- Zlob has provided a very good photo build guide that you can follow along with as you go, and it shows you where each new component goes

\- it's important to get the headers at the correct angles, precisely perpendicular to the board, otherwise you'll have difficulty mating up the two boards after wards

\- with things like IC sockets, I like to solder one pin, and then with the iron still touching, press down (or up) with my finger to make sure the assembly is lying flat on the board, before removing the iron from the pin. Tape is required to keep the part on the board before you flip it over, but sometimes even tape can sag.
