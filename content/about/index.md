Hi, my name is Eugene, I’m a recording engineer and music producer based in Toronto, Ontario. I’ve been in the industry since the mid 90s. Music is my passion.

In 2023 I began this site as a way to document my eurorack build, as I committed to doing as much of it via DIY as possible. I hope to learn and to share what I’ve learned, and to chart my progress along the way.

Be kind, make music.
